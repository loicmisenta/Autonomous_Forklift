<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This project was developed for the CS-356 Making Intelligent Things
course at EPFL. The team members are Loïc Misenta, Hadrien Saigot
Forest, Inés Araujo Cañas, Athena Papageorgiou Koufidou, Kalil Sama
Bouzigues and Dylan Vairoli.</p>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>The autonomous forklift is a project aimed at automating the movement
of packets within a facility. When placing a packet in front of the
forklift, it uses a camera to read and process a QR code on the packet.
The QR code contains information about the packet’s intended location in
the facility. The forklift then picks it up and moves in a to the
designated location and places the packet on the ground. Upon
completion, the forklift returns to its starting position, ready to
repeat the process with another packet. Manual controls are also
available with a gamepad or a web application.</p>

<h1 id="tools">Tools</h1>
<p>For this project, we used a Prusa 3D printer and a laser cutter, both
available at <a
href="https://www.epfl.ch/education/educational-initiatives/discovery-learning-program-2/prototyping/page-111858-en-html/">The
SPOT</a> at EPFL. The 3D printer was used to print the wheels and
structures for cable and electronic components management, while the
laser cutter was used to create the base platform, boxes and forks.
Other tools needed for this project include a soldering iron, a
multimeter, a screwdriver and other basic tools. The software you are
going to need is the Arduino IDE and a text editor of your choice.
<!-- List of required tools would go here, e.g. laser cutter, 3d printer etc., perhaps also a note about were to obtain them or where to find access to them --></p>
<h1 id="safety">Safety</h1>
<p>It is important to be aware of potential risks associated with the
tools and processes involved. The use of tools such as 3D printers,
laser cutters, soldering irons, and other equipment can pose certain
hazards. When operating these tools, there is a risk of burns, electric
shocks, or injuries from moving parts. To mitigate these risks, it is
crucial to follow safety guidelines provided by the tool manufacturers
and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as safety
glasses, gloves, and closed-toe shoes. Ensure that the work area is
well-ventilated and free from clutter, providing a safe environment for
operating tools. Take precautions when handling hot or sharp objects,
and avoid touching heated surfaces directly. Additionally, exercise
caution when working with electrical components or circuits, ensuring
proper insulation, grounding, and adherence to safe soldering practices.
Regularly inspect and maintain the tools and equipment to ensure they
are in good working condition.</p>

<p>We decided to go with MDF as the primary material for our forklift.
It is quite cheap and easily modifiable, while we were prototyping we
could quickly drill some new holes and so on.</p>

<p>We took the base from the <a

Mecanum Wheels Robot</a> project by <a

we slightly adapted to use comb joints and have some more holes so that
we can glue parts together and pass cables through it.</p>

<p>We designed some side supports to attach the two side shafts on which
the forks are drilled. They are quite massive but it was giving a nice

<p>Also using this comb joints technique, we added a cap that can easily
be removed on top of the base platform. It gives a polished and refined
aspect to our vehicle by hiding all the cables.</p>

Forks of the forklift.

</figure>
<p>Obviously, we also had to create the forks that are used to take the
boxes. Our first try was a failure because it was too thin and couldn’t
lift anything without breaking. This final model works better but it
still needs brackets to support at least two kilograms. We 3D-printed
them because we couldn’t get any metal one, but 10x10mm metal brackets
are enough.</p>

Fixations of the forklift.

</figure>
<p>Along the way, we encountered small issues for which we had to design
some small 3D-printed pieces - To hold the two side shafts - To hold the
central screw shaft - To attach the forks to the block bearings - To
keep the vertical end switch at the right position - To avoid that the
side shafts get out of the fixations when lifting up. Because our block
bearings didn’t slide perfectly smoothly along our shafts, we needed
some caps to force them to stay inside the fixations - To hold the
ESP32-CAM against the forks as well as the horizontal end switch</p>
<p>You can find the <code>.stl</code> files for these pieces at <a

<h2 id="cable-management">Cable management</h2>
<p>To keep our circuit clean and avoid short circuits because of
floating components, we designed structures to cleanly manage our
cables.</p>
<ul>
<li>One that is used to wrap the cables around</li>
<li>One to screw our PCB board to the base</li>
<li>One to attach the ESP8266 to the base</li>
</ul>
<p>However all of these pieces are very specific to our usecase so it
may not suit perfectly your components.</p>

</figure>
<p>Any forklift needs some counterweight at the back of it to balance
with the weight it is carrying. To do so, we opted for a 3D-printed box
with round edges so that nothing gets stuck in them. You can then fill
it with whatever you want, rocks or sand for example.</p>

</figure>
<p>Mecanum wheels allow you to move sideways, turn in place as well as
go diagonally with only 4 independent wheels. By turning the wheels with
a specific combination of directions, you can achieve the desired
effect.</p>
<p>We used the <a

Mecanum Wheels Robot</a> project as a basis for our wheels. You can
either download the <code>.stl</code> files from his tutorial or you can

Pay attention to print two right wheels and two left wheels. For more
details about the mounting of these wheels, you can check <a

<p>Note that we had to slightly modify the outer part of the wheels
because we did not have any M3 bolts that were 45mm long, only 40mm.</p>

<h2 id="a4988-stepper-driver">A4988 stepper driver</h2>
<p>We used A4988 stepper drivers to control our steppers. However we
need to limit the output current they produce to 1.5A. To do so we need
to adjust the small screw on top of them. Follow the <em>A4988 Current
Limiting</em> section of <a

(<a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/t/arduino-uno-cnc-shield-controlling-4-stepper-motors/913742/3">source</a>).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The CNC shield is very simple to use, you just need to plug it on top
of the Arduino UNO and install the drivers on top of it.</p>
<p>However be careful with a few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Enable</code> pin of the drivers should be at the position
marked as <code>EN</code> on the shield.</li>
<li>As we use the 4 steppers independently, we need to indicate that the
<code>A</code> (red) driver is controlled on its own. This is done by
connecting a jumper at the green and orange spots in the image above.
(<a
href="https://www.zyltech.com/arduino-cnc-shield-instructions/">source</a>).</li>
<li>For smoother movement, we decided to use 16x microstepping. This is
not mandatory but it works best with the mecanum wheels in our opinion.
To do so, you need to connect jumper wires on all the <code>M0</code>,
<code>M1</code> and <code>M2</code> pins. You can find more information
about other microstepping resolutions <a
href="https://www.zyltech.com/arduino-cnc-shield-instructions/">here</a>.</li>
<li>When plugging in the motors, they might turn in the incorrect
direction or you might have plugged steppers in different locations as
us. You can test this by uploading the <code>steppers_test.ino</code>
sketch to the Arduino UNO. It should start turning the steppers
clockwise in this order: back left, front left, back right, front right.
If they turn counter-clockwise instead, you need to turn their cables by
180 degrees. If they turn in an incorrect order, try to switch the
positions where they’re plugged in the shield accordingly.</li>
<li>You can find the mapping between the Arduino UNO pins number and the
actual controls of the shield in the <code>arduino_main.ino</code>
sketch.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="esp8266">ESP8266</h2>
<p>Unfortunately the Arduino UNO we used does not have WIFI
capabilities. As we needed to transfer instructions from the computer
using WIFI to our boards, we used an ESP8266. We can consider it as the
brain of our circuit, it receives the instructions from the computer
online and dispatch it either to the Arduino UNO to move the wheels or
to itself to control the vertical stepper. As we just mentioned, it is
also responsible to control the vertical stepper motor because the
Arduino UNO had all of its pins busy with the shield.</p>
<h2 id="esp32-cam">ESP32-CAM</h2>
<p>To scan QR codes we needed a camera, the ESP32-cam was perfect for
that as it also has WIFI capabilities. When reading a QR code, it sends
its payload (which is simply a number) to the computer which then send
the correct instruction to the ESP8266 based on the number it
received.</p>
<h2 id="nema-17-stepper-motors">NEMA 17 stepper motors</h2>
<p>We use 5 NEMA17 stepper motors; 4 for the wheels and one for the
forks. They are strong motors capable of lifting up our boxes. You can
find more information about how stepper motors work <a

<h2 id="conrad-energy-lipo-battery-11.1v-5000mah">Conrad Energy Lipo
battery 11.1V 5000mAh</h2>
<p>As a power supply for our steppers and the Arduino UNO, we used a 12V
Lipo battery.</p>
<h2 id="v-to-10v-battery">5V to 10V battery</h2>
<p>You will also need any kind of 5V to 10V power source for the ESP8266
because it can’t take the 12V of the Lipo battery.</p>

<h2 id="arduino-uno">Arduino UNO</h2>
<p>The Arduino UNO is only responsible to move the wheels of the
forklift. It receives instructions from the ESP8266 about where to go
using serial communication. We used the <code>AccelStepper</code>
library to control our steppers.</p>

<h2 id="esp8266-2">ESP8266</h2>
<p>The ESP8266 is the brain of our forklift. It receives instruction
from the computer using WIFI and dispatch them correctly to the Arduino
UNO if needed, to itself otherwise. It keeps track of the positions of
our grid and the current state of the forklift. It also controls the
vertical stepper motor.</p>

<h3 id="qr-code-recognition">QR code recognition</h3>
<p>We can also send instructions to the ESP8266 by scanning a QR code.
The QR code should contain a number between 1 and 6. The ESP8266 will
then move the forklift to the corresponding position in the facility.
You can find the code for this at <a
href="https://gitlab.epfl.ch/papageor/cs-356-autonomous-forklift/-/tree/main/QR_Code">QR_Code</a>.</p>
<p>The QR code handling is a big part of the project. The way it works
is the following. The ESP32- CAM scan the QR Code present on the box,
send the id number of the box to the computer which has a .csv file with
all the data that corresponds to the box, then send the placement of the
box to the ESP8266 that can after move appropriately given the
information that was in the .csv file. The ESP8266 is also responsible
for telling the ESP32-CAM to start scanning QR code.</p>

<p>In the Arduino file there is multiple sections.<br />
The first section is the configuration of the server of the ESP32, the
connection to the server of the computer, the initialisation of camera
and the handling of HTTP request coming from the ESP8266. The second one
is the handling of the QR code scan. In this section the scanning will
begin only if the ESP8266 want a scan. If so it will search for a QR
code and if it finds one, it send the id found by an HTTP request to the
server running on the computer. If there is no error a flash will be
done to have a visual confirmation that the id was correctly sent. The
third part is where the server, the client, the camera are all setup
correctly to handle all situation</p>
<h4 id="data.csv">data.csv</h4>
<p>This file contains a table of 3 columns : id, type and description.
The id is used to know what box it is and where it is going, the type
and the description are for the display on the webpage to know what is
inside.</p>
<h4 id="server.js">server.js</h4>
<p>This is where the local server on the computer is setup. When it
received an http request with the id, it will scan each row of the csv
file to get all the information needed to send to ESP8266.</p>
<h3 id="problems-encountered">Problems encountered</h3>
<p>The main problem that I have encountered is the scanning of the QR
Code. I spent a lot of time finding and understanding the libraries for
scanning. There were many of them so I have to tried many to find the
best. In this project we wanted to scan quick, also the main question
was : “What do I put in my QR Code ?”. At first I tried to put a JSON
text but the camera detect it very slowly so I tried to find some
compression algorithms like “shoco” which compress little string but not
efficient. Finally I found a way to have only a little information on
the QR, an id, and all the rest on a csv file on the computer. But to do
this I have to learn JavaScript and how to create a server, with Node in
my case.<br />
Another problem was the voltage of the ESP32-CAM. This one randomly give
an infinite loop of error misunderstanding. At first I was thinking it
was my code, so I spent few days to recode all. After a deep search I
found that this ESP32-CAM needs 5V and not 3V when it used a lot of
resources, like QR Code scanning. But I was using my ESP8266 to send,
and decode code so it was relies with the 3V of the ESP8266. I wrote
these line for you to know where I spent my time and to help others
students in the future to not spending weeks and weeks to debug.</p>
<h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>
<p>There are several navigation options that can be used to guide the
vehicle to the correct path. Since the forklift will be moving in a
known facility, we decided to use a form of graph-based navigation,
i.e. to divide the facility into a grid of possible positions or nodes,
with edges connecting the nodes representing possible paths that the
forklift can take. The forklift can use this graph to find the shortest
path to a destination node based on its current position and the
instructions associated with each node. This approach is simple and easy
to implement, as it does not require complex sensors or computer vision
algorithms and efficient, as the graph can be precomputed and stored,
making the navigation process faster.</p>
<p>This form of navigation proved to be sufficient for our use case, as
the forklift was able to reach its destination with accuracy and without
any issues. However, it is not the most robust solution, as it does not
account for obstacles or other dynamic changes in the environment. For
example, if a box is placed in the middle of the path, the forklift will
not be able to detect it and will continue to move forward, potentially
colliding with the box. To address this issue, we could use a
combination of graph-based navigation and computer vision, where the
forklift can use the graph to find the shortest path to the destination
and use computer vision to detect obstacles and avoid collisions. This
approach would be more robust, as it would allow the forklift to adapt
to changes in the environment and avoid obstacles. However, it would
also be more complex to implement, as it would require more sensors and
computer vision algorithms.</p>
<p>Another possible implementation was using a map where each position
are represented as 2D vectors, the x-component is the horizontal
distance to travel for the forklift to reach the box in that position
and the y-component is the vertical distance to travel from the starting
point to where the box stands in that given position. This way we can
make any large number of boxes and the map will be made accordingly
using a function with a for-loop. The thing is that, in real life the
wheels slip a little§ bit on the floor, and even if each box are spaced
by a certain equal distance, the vertical distance to each box are not
exactly multiple of the vertical step. In that way, we had to
recalibrate those steps with some arbtrary coefficient and measure every
vertical distance to each position.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This project was a great opportunity to learn about the different
aspects of robotics, from the mechanical design and construction of the
forklift to the electronics and software implementation. We were able to
apply the concepts learned in class to a real-world application, which
allowed us to gain a better understanding of the material. We also
learned how to use new tools and technologies, such as Fusion 360,
Arduino, and ESP8266, which will be useful for future projects. Overall,
we are satisfied with the results of the project, as we were able to
successfully implement the forklift and achieve our goal of automating
the movement of packets within a facility.</p>
